```{r probability using rbinom}

x <- 100000
resultList <- logical(x)

for(y in 1:x)
  {
    testString <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
    count0 <- 0
    count1 <- 0
    
    for(i in 1:100)
    {
      if(testString[i] == 0)
      {
        count0 <- count0 + 1
        count1 <- 0
    
        if(count0 == 7)
          resultList[y] <- TRUE       
      }
      else
      {
        count1 <- count1 + 1
        count0 <- 0
    
        if(count1 == 7)
          resultList[y] <- TRUE       
      }
    }
}
true <- sum(resultList)
probability <- true/x
print(probability)

```

With just 10 sequences, the result is fairly inconsistent.  With 100 that is much improved, and running 1,000 plus is almost the same result every time. 0.54

As far as performance goes, R handled the calculation in about the same amount of time for 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 - 5 to 6 seconds.  At 100,000, the calculation took about 30 seconds.
